# Groep project 
For the groep project we used the agile work method scrum. We chose this because we and the finnish students had worked with it before. We discused using a Kanban board but disided agianst it because there are no sprints. And since we worked sepertily it was better we had sprints with sprint reviews at the end. This way everyone was up to date on what was done and still needed to be worked on.

For managing the project we used [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/). With Taiga we had a scrum board with all the userstorys and we devided the userstorys into tasks that we could do. sice there were 3 groups (2 frontend and 1 backend) we first dicided to use 2 scrumboards. And we had to change 2 boards everytime we finnished a task or userstory. we quicly came to the conclusion that we had to make 3 boards and every team just managed their onw board. 

We used tiga because one of the finnish teachers recomanded it.
