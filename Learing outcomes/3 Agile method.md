# Group project 
For the group project, we used the agile work method scrum. We chose this because the Finnish students as well as ourself had worked with this method before. We discussed using a Kanban board but decided against it because there are no sprints. And since we worked separately it was better we had sprints with sprint reviews at the end. This way everyone was up to date on what was done and still needed to be worked on.

For managing the project we used [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/). With Taiga, we had a scrum board with all the user stories. We divided the user stories into tasks that we could work on. During the standup we discused what tasks we would work on that day. Since there were 3 groups (2 frontend groups and 1 backend) we first decided to use 2 scrum boards and had to change 2 boards every time we finished a task or user story. We came to the conclusion that we had to make 3 boards and every team just managed their own board. 

We used Tiga because one of the Finnish teachers recommended it.
