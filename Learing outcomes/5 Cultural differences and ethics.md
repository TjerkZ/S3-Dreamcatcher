# Cultural differences
You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.

# what is culture?
Culture, quite a vage term and yet everyone understands what you mean when you say it. Acording to the [cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org) the meaning is:

> the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time:

>   - This is one of the most ancient cultures in the world.

Not 2 dictonary's give the same awnser and people have diferent interpetations.

Geert Hofstede a dutch sincetist made a framework called Hofstede's Cultrual Dimensions Theory. This can be used to determine how buissniss is done in difrent cultres. And to some extend can alos  be used to see if 2 culters can cooperte.

In this framework there are 6 dimentions that a culture is rated on. these are:
- 1 Power distance
- 2 Collectivism vs. individualism
- 3 uncertainty avooidance index
- 4 masculininty vs femininity
- 5 long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation
- 6 indulgence vs. restraint
