# Cultural differences
You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.

# what is culture?
Culture is quite a vague term and yet everyone understands what you mean when you say it. According to the [cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org) the meaning is:

> the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time:
>   - She's studying modern Japanese language and culture.
>   - This is one of the most ancient cultures in the world.

Not 2 dictionaries give the same answer and people have different interpretations. 

## The cultural dimensions framework?
Geert Hofstede, a dutch scientist, made a framework called Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory. This can be used to determine how business is done in different cultures, and to some extent can also be used to see if 2 cultures can cooperate.

In this framework, there are 6 dimensions that culture is rated on. these are:
- 1 Power distance
- 2 Collectivism vs. individualism
- 3 uncertainty avoidance index
- 4 masculinity vs femininity
- 5 long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation
- 6 indulgence vs. restraint

## Personal experiences
In software, the likely hood of you meeting or cooperating with people from different cultures is high, to say the least. This semester I did a group project with 2 teams from Finland. They both made a frontend and we were responsible for the backend. Communication was an important aspect of the project since we were in different countries for the majority of the time. During the project we had weekly meetings and every 3 or 4 weeks a sprint review. 

When we started the project [Timo](https://github.com/timojw/), [Rens](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/) and myself went to Finland to meet the Finnish students. In the Last week of the project the Finnish students came to Eindhoven so we could show our final product. During these 2 weeks and in the online meetings, I noticed some differences. [AFMAKEN]

## Differences in the cultural dimensions framework
What I experienced while working on the project is that our cultures don't differ that much. Looking at the dimensions framework the Netherlands and Finland score verry close to eachother with only minor differences. [AFMAKEN]
