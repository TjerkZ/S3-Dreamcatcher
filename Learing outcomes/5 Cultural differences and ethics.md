# Cultural differences
You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.

# what is culture?
Culture is quite a vague term and yet everyone understands what you mean when you say it. According to the [cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org) the meaning is:

> the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time:
>   - She's studying modern Japanese language and culture.
>   - This is one of the most ancient cultures in the world.

Not 2 dictionaries give the same answer and people have different interpretations. 

## The cultural dimensions framework
Geert Hofstede, a dutch scientist, made a framework called Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory. This can be used to determine how business is done in different cultures, and to some extent can also be used to see if 2 cultures can cooperate.

In this framework, there are 6 dimensions that culture is rated on. these are:
- 1 Power distance
- 2 Collectivism vs. individualism
- 3 uncertainty avoidance index
- 4 masculinity vs femininity
- 5 long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation
- 6 indulgence vs. restraint

## Personal experiences
In software, the likely hood of you meeting or cooperating with people from different cultures is high, to say the least. This semester I did a group project with 2 teams from Finland. They both made a frontend and we were responsible for the backend. Communication was an important aspect of the project since we were in different countries for the majority of the time. During the project we had weekly meetings and every 3 or 4 weeks a sprint review. 

When we started the project [Timo](https://github.com/timojw/), [Rens](https://github.com/RensVlooswijk/) and I went to Finland to meet the Finnish students. In the last week of the project, the Finnish students came to Eindhoven so we could show our final product. During these 2 weeks and in the online meetings, I noticed some differences in our culture. While in Finland I noticed that they are very polite people and willing to help each other but also that they like to mind their own business. This is also what we discussed whit the Finnish students and they said that one factor that contributed to the differences is conscription. In Finland conscription is still required and they take pride in that. Being in the army creates discipline and comradery something that made me think about maybe also joining the army for a short time. But despite our differences, the cooperation was good and went fairly smootly

## Differences in the cultural dimensions framework
What I experienced while working on the project is that our cultures don't differ that much. Looking at the dimensions framework the Netherlands and Finland score very close to each other with only minor differences. In each category we score fairly close to Finland the real differences are in Masculinity, long-term orientation, and individualism. On the scale you can see that Finland is more masculine this indicates that society is more driven by competition and achievements. something I think is more present in the Finnish culture. On individualism, we score higher and I also saw that in the form that they were proud to be Finnish and of the things Finland has accomplished. despite falling roughly in the same category of culture the differences were noticeble.
