# Dream catcher
For my personal project i created an app called dreamcatcher. the porpse of het app is that you can save dreams you had. Of all the dreams you save you can see statiscis for example how manny bad dreams you had this year. 

## Frontend
[s3-dreamcatcher-site repository](https://github.com/TjerkZ/s3-dreamcatcher-site)
For the frontend of the application i used React. This is a javacript framwork created by facebook. i'v chosen react beqause i had never used it and it is the most popular framework acording to these 2 sites:
[Most used web framework stackoverflow surve](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks)
[State of JS](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks)
### Design
The site is made using [react bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) this way it looks nice and is userfriendly. And because it uses bootstrap it's also also works on phone.

For the login I use auth0 so users can login with a account that they can make or with their google acount.

# backend
For the backend i made a API with C# ASP.NET core. This api provides the data for the frontend in Json format. The reason that i made it in C# is beqause i wanted to becaome beter and had never made a API with C#.
