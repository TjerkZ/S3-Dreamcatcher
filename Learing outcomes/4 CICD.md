# CICD
You **implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.
# API
For the CICD of the API I made 2 branches on GitHub on for development and a main. If something is pushed to the main branch, I set up GitHub actions to build, test and publish it.

## Github Actions
I made 2 files that GitHub action can use, the [main.yml](https://github.com/TjerkZ/s3-dreamcatcher-api/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) First builds the app. This is the code you see under the build job. after that, it creates a docker image and pushes that to docker hub. That part is under the publish job.

```

  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal
  
  publish:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

      - name: Log into registry ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
        if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        uses: docker/login-action@28218f9b04b4f3f62068d7b6ce6ca5b26e35336c

      - name: Extract Docker metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@98669ae865ea3cffbcbaa878cf57c20bbf1c6c38
        with:
          images: tjerkzeilstra/s3-dreamcatcher-api

      # Build and push Docker image with Buildx (don't push on PR) 
      # https://github.com/docker/build-push-action
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        id: build-and-push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@ad44023a93711e3deb337508980b4b5e9bcdc5dc
        with:
          file: ./s3-dreamcatcher-api/Dockerfile
          push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
          tags: tjerkzeilstra/s3-dreamcatcher-api:latest
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```

The [build.yml](https://github.com/TjerkZ/s3-dreamcatcher-api/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) file is for testing the application with static code analyses from Sonarcloud. After the job is done executing, the results are on Sonarcloud website where you then can monitor issues.

# React Site

The CICD of the React site is nearly identical to CICD of the API. When I commit to the main branch of the React site repository, it gets tested, build and pushed to docker hub using GitHub actions. GitHub uses the build.yml file below to do this.

```
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [17.x]
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    # - name: Run the tests
    #   run: npm test
    - name: Build
      run: CI='' npm run build -- --prod
      
  deployment:
    name: deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: ./
        file: ./Dockerfile
        push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/frontend:latest
```

While not in the GitHub actions, the React site is also being monitored by sonarcloud. This is done automatically by Sonarcloud when I push something to main.

# Docker
When the docker images are on docker hub, I can pull it to my home server where I run the API and the site. To run all the service in docker, I made a docker compose. The docker compose file contains:
- react site
- API
- SQL container
- Watchtower

And look like this:
```
Compose file
```

## Watchtower
With [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) The latest image gets pulled from Dockerhub. I configured watchtower to check Dockerhub every 10 minutes, so when I commit to the main branch it takes around 10 minutes for the new version to go live. This way, the deployment of new versions is automatic.

# Eventify
For Eventify my task was to deploy the API on my home server. We set up a GitHub action for all the services so that they get pushed to Dockerhub. From there, I made a docker compose file that pulled all the services from Dockerhub. In the docker compose, I also injected the connection string for the database. This was done so  we could have a different connection string on our local machines. With Watchtower, the images get pulled automatically every 10 minutes. 

docker compose file of evintify:
```
