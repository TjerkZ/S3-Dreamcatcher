# CICD
You **implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.
# API
For the CICD of the API i made 2 branches on github on for development and a main. If shomething is pushed to the main brench i set up github actions to build, test and publish it. 

## main.yml
I made 2 files that githubaction can use, the [main.yml](https://github.com/TjerkZ/s3-dreamcatcher-api/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) First builds the app. This is the code you see under the build job. afther that it creates a docker image an pushes that to docker hub. that part is under the publish job.

```
name: .NET

  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      run: dotnet build --no-restore
    - name: Test

  publish:

```

## build.yml
The [build.yml](https://github.com/TjerkZ/s3-dreamcatcher-api/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) file is for testing the application with static code analyses from sonarcloud. after the job is done executing the resualts are on sonarclouds website where you than can monitor issues.

# React Site

The CICD of the react site the procces is identical to CICD of the API. When I commit to the main brench of the react site repository it gets tested, build and pushed to docker hub using github actions. Github uses the build.yml file below to do this. 



```
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [17.x]
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    # - name: Run the tests
    #   run: npm test
    - name: Build
      run: CI='' npm run build -- --prod
      
  deployment:
    name: deployment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: ./
        file: ./Dockerfile
        push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/frontend:latest
```

While not in the github actions the react site is also being monitored by sonarcloud. this is done automaticly by sonarcloud when i push somthing to main.

# Docker
When its on docker hub I can pull it to my homeserver where i run the API. To run all the service in docker i made a docker compse. The docker compse file contains:
- react site
- API
- SQL container
- Watchtower

And look like this:
```
Compose file
```

## Watchtower
With [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) The lates image gets pulled from dockerhub. I configured watchtower to check dockerhub every 10 minits so when i commit to main it takes around 10 minutes for the new version to go live.

# Eventify
