# Group project Eventify
### Introduction
For the group project i partacipated in a "exange" project where we went to finland an made a project with finnish sudents. We made [Eventify](https://github.com/Eeventify/main) withc is a socailmedia for orginasing events.

I think i showed most of my professional skills in the group project.

### scrum
For the planning we used a [taiga board](https://tree.taiga.io) this is a scrumboard and we used it because on of the finnish teachers recomended it. On this board we had all user stories. after using it in this procect i would recomed it because it makes working with scrum easer. 

At the end of each sprint we had a meating with the finnish students and teachers to show our progress and plan what we would do next sprint. We as a group always made a presentaion and 

### Defenition of done

### API comunication
In my opinion the comuniation aubout the api that we were making went wel. We set up CICD pipline with automatic [swagger documentation](https://eeventify.github.io/main/) that the finish studenst could use for their frontend. 


# Indivual project

### Reflection
The planning and effort that went into the indivual project was flatout bad. In the begin of the semester I manly foces on getting the group project up and running. this and the lack of motivation are the cause that i'v done almost nothing for my indivual project. 

Then Leon got sick and we got a new teacher but then i got sick for a week and could't go to school some days for other reasons. I essentialy gave up until Bert said that i could still make it and i made a checklist with all the things I had to do.

The last week was very productive and I made a lot of progress esspecaly in my portfolio. From this week I discoverd 2 importend things:
 1. I accualy enjoyed writing a proftolio.
 2. That if you plan your work efficent you can realy get a lot of work done.

Despite the outcome of this semester i'm aculay motivated for once and im looking forward to creating somthing i'm proud of next semester, instead of doing everthing last minut and making shomthing that only shows the learning outcomes.

Decpite the bad year I beleave that i have learnd a lot. i'v learnd a lot about cicd and testing. I'v also leard how to use react, docker and github actions. things i had no clue what they wore so althou my professional manner was bad i'm still glad that I did this semester.
