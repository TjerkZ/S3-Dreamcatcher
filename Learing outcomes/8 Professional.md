# Group project Eventify
### Introduction
For the group project, I participated in an "exchange" project where we went to Finland and made a project with Finnish students. We made [Eventify](https://github.com/Eeventify/main) which is a social media for organizing events.

I think I showed most of my professional skills in the group project.

### scrum
For the planning we used a [Taiga board](https://tree.taiga.io) this is a scrum board and we used Taiga because one of the Finnish teachers recommended it. On this board, we had all user stories. after using it in this project I would recommend it because it makes working with scrum easier. 

At the end of each sprint, we had a meeting with the Finnish students and teachers to show our progress and plan what we would do next sprint. We as a group always made a presentation and 

### Defenition of done
Whit our group we set up a definition of done. we used this to determine if we were done with a user story. 

### API communication
In my opinion, the communication about the API that we were making went well. We set up a CICD pipeline with automatic [swagger documentation](https://eeventify.github.io/main/) that the finish students could use for their frontend. We also made a Discord server where we could ask questions and have online meetings.

### Reflection
The planning and effort that went into the individual project were bad. At the beginning of the semester, I mainly focused on getting the group project up and running. this and the lack of motivation are the cause that I 'v done almost nothing for my individual project. 

Then Leon got sick and we got a new teacher but then I got sick for a week and couldn't go to school some days for other reasons. I had essentially already given up until Bert said that I could still make it and I made a checklist with all the things I had to do.

The last week was very productive and I made a lot of progress, especially in my portfolio. From this week I discovered 2 important things:
 1. I enjoyed writing a portfolio.
 2. That if you plan your work efficiently you can get a lot of work done.

Despite the outcome of this semester, I'm aculay motivated for once and I'm looking forward to creating something I'm proud of next semester, instead of doing everything last minute and making something that only shows the learning outcomes.

Despite the bad year, I believe that I have learned a lot. I've learned a lot about CICD and testing. I've also learned how to use react, docker, and GitHub actions. things I had no clue what they were so although my professional manner was bad I'm still glad that I did this semester.
