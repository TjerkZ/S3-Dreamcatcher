# Software and ethics
There is no doubt that software has a inpact on people their lives. These days it hard to find someone how doesn't use software in some from or way. Most of the time software aims to help people and better their lives but saidly there is also software that intetionly tries to harm people or impact their lives in a negitve way. And then there are applications like socail media that doen't nesesrly have a melicios 

## Code of ethics
The [ACM](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/) made a code of etics document that lists how softwaredevolpers should think about their software before releasing it. On their page about the etical priciples it states this:
> Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

### the 8 princaples of software engineering
> 1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
>2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
>3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
>4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
>5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
>6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
>7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
>8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

## Why is ethics important
As stated earlyer the impact of software on poeple their lifes is huge and our sociaty would't be as it is today without it. A [reasherch in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/748551/worldwide-households-with-computer/) shows that 47.1% of househols have a computer in their home. this means As a software developer your software is avalible to a large portion of the population. Therefore develpers should think about the impact that their software can have and should aim only to release software with a positve impact on poeple there lifes.

## What can software engeneers do to make software that doesn't have nagitve impact
Following the software engineering princaples of the AMC a software engeneer has to be awair and onest about their abbilty and education. They shoul also collect information and report back to their cleint if the software violates any laws. Of course Jugement sould also been taken into considuration if the software doesn't break any law but is unetical. They must also manege their software in a profecional way so that only the poeple that 

## How to ens that your program isn't unetical?
For one the software that is released shouldn't brake any laws in the country it is released in. Other than that it is difficult to realy determain if software it etical. The best thing is to open a discution about it and see first what other developers have to say about it and what teir conserns are. afther that you can do a closed alpha test and see what other poeple think about the ethical impact of the application.

# Ethics in my project

The confilct in my application that could have a etical problem is the userdata. The app i made called dreamcatcher is to save dreams you had and see statiscs about your dream paterens. You can also share your dreams if you like to. It could be seen as a socail media about dreams. A lot of socail media comapiy's sell userdata in one way or another mainly for marketing campains. This way they create targeted add that they can sell. At first clanse that seams higly unetical and seen not only as a privicy issue. But on the other side of the conversation the socail media platforms that we use are free of charge and they need to make money. And using user data to provide persinal advertisements is a effective way to monitise their platforms. 

In my opinion they have taken it to far and can also have adds that aren't so targeted and generate suficent reveniew. For my app i won't be using userdata to create reveniew i think a untarged add and mabey a subcription model would sufice.
