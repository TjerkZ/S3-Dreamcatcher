# Software and ethics
There is no doubt that software has an impact on people's lives. These days it is hard to find someone who doesn't use software in one way or the other. Most of the time software aims to help people and make their lives better. Sadly enough there is also software that intentionally tries to harm people or negatively impact their lives. Also there are applications like social media that don't necessarily have malicious intent but users can abuse the platforms and bring harm to other people.

## Code of ethics
The [ACM](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/) made a code of ethics document that lists how software developers should think about their software before releasing it. On their page about the ethical principles it states this:
> Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:

### the 8 principles of software engineering
> 1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
>2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
>3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
>4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
>5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
>6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
>7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
>8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

## Why is ethics important
As stated earlier the impact of software on people their lives are huge and our society wouldn't be as it is today without it. A [reasherch in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/748551/worldwide-households-with-computer/) shows that 47.1% of households have a computer in their home. This means as a software developer your software is available to a large portion of the population. Therefore developers should think about the impact that their software can have and should aim only to release software with a positive impact on people lives.

## What can software engineers do to make software that doesn't have a negative impact
Following the software engineering principles of the AMC, a software engineer has to be aware and honest about their ability and education. They should also collect information and report back to their client if the software violates any laws. Of course, Judgment should also be taken into consideration if the software doesn't break any law but is unethical. They must also manage their software in a professional way so that only the people that [AFMAKEN]

## How to ensure that your program isn't unethical?
For starters the software that is released shouldn't break any laws in the country it is released. Other than that it is difficult to determine if software is ethical. The best thing is to open a discussion about it and see first what other developers have to say about it and what their concerns are. After that you can do a closed alpha test and see what other people think about the ethical impact of the application.

# Ethics in my project

The conflict in my application that could have an ethical problem is the user data. The app I made called dreamcatcher is to save dreams you had and see statistics about your dream patterns. You can also share your dreams if you like to. It could be seen as social media about dreams. A lot of social media companies sell user data in one way or another mainly for marketing campaigns. This way they create targeted ads that they can sell. At first, glance that seems highly unethical and seen not only as a privacy issue. On the other side of the conversation the social media platforms that we use are free of charge and they need to make money. And using user data to provide personalized advertisements is an effective way to monetize their platforms. 

In my opinion, they have taken it too far and can also have ads that aren't so targeted and generate sufficient revenue. For my app I won't be using user data to create revenue I think untargeted ads and a subscription model would suffice.
