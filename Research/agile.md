# Agile work methods

## What is agile
Agile software devolopment is a way to develop software in a iterative way. Tradional software devolopment is ofthen seen as liniar, Agile is made to make devlopment more transparent and better adapt to changes in de requirements. While there are lots of Agile methods they all share a set of core consepts these are defined by the [12 Agile Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

## Diverent methods
There are lots of diverent ways to work agile and while the all share the same core contsepts they can be totaly diverent from one a nother. There are constantly beinge made new agile methods and everyone can have teir onw implementation of these methods. But here is a list of some popular methods:
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme programming
- Lean devlopment
- Crystal

in this research i'l be discorvering 3 of these constepts.

# Scrum
Scrum is a agile mehtod where a team or indiviual works in sprints. These sprints are a difinded time frames often about 2 to 3 weeks where 

## Team
In a scrum there are some names for people involed in the project. The terminology divers from one to the other site but the rol stays the same.
- Team member / devloper is a part of the team and helps to devolop the app.
- Scrum master is in charge of the scrum bord and guides the team. Usaly the person in charge of the standup. 
- Product owener
- Stake holder


## how does scrum work?
A project start by writing user stories witch are stories of what a user of the software wants to be able to do whitin the application. these sories are then placed in a list called the product backlog. The user stories in the backlog are given a priority on what needs to be first developt. A popuar method to give priority is MOSCOW. At the beginning of a sprint you have a sprint planning where you dicide what userstories are going to make. These userstories are placed in the sprintbacklog. While in the sprint there is a daily standup alos known as daily scrum where every team meber says what they did and what their going to do. When the sprint is over there is a sprint review. In this review the progress is shown to the product owner. The product owner also needs to aprove the made fucntionalties. Afther the review the backlog is updated for changes and ther is a retrospective. In the retrospective you looking at what you are goeing to do divently next sprint. afther that you make a new sprint planning.

# Kanban
Kanan is a aglile work method and has as strong point that the work is visualised on a kanbanboard. On such a canbanboard there are rows that have cards in them. On every card there is a task and someone that is working on that task. The way Kanban works there is full trancparancy of the work. 

## board
The board as said earlyer has rows depending on the project there ar usaly 4 rows:
- To do
- In progress
- Code review
- Done

In the TODO row are the cards that still need to be done. The inprogress row is for the tasks that people are working on. The code review is for testing and reviewing the code. this row is optional and depends on the defintion of done of the project. And lastly done here are the cards that are done.

Before and during devolopment there is a set ammount of cards that can be on in progress and in code review that is called WIP or work in progress. This is to keep it orgenised and to make sure that people are not doing to mutch in one time. 

# Extreme Programming
Extreme programming is also a popular method of working agile with focus on software quality. It has a short development cycles with the intend of improving productifty. The way work is pland is that you only develop functionaltys when they are needed. In the image below you can see the extrem programming planning/feedback loops:
